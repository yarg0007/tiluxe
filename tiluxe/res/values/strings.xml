    <string name="update_message">
    The menu button has now been enabled during game play. Pressing the menu 
    button presents three options, Reset Game, New Game and Options. Reset Game 
    clears the current board of all your progress and restores it to the 
    starting configuration. New Game generates a brand new board with the same 
    size and difficulty. Options presents the options menu where you can change 
    the board size and difficulty. Changing either of these settings will 
    generate a new board with the board size and difficulty you have chosen.
    
    Enjoy!

    Welcome to Tiluxe. You can always revisit this 
    tutorial from the Options menu. Hit the back button to skip it.
    \n\n
    Tiluxe is about turning on the correct tiles to win the game. Selecting a 
    tile once will turn it on (white). Selecting the same tile 
    again will turn it off (black). Select it one more time to reset it. 
    Turn on the tile above to continue the tutorial.
    </string>
    
    <string name="tutorial_two">
    The legend around the board will change colors, from red to green, based on 
    the state of the respective row or column. Red numbers indicate the 
    row or column is not correct in terms of the number of tiles turned on. 
    Green numbers indicate the row or column is correct. 
    To continue, turn on the correct tile based on the legend values and colors.
    </string>
    
    <string name="tutorial_three">
    Tiles that need to be turned on cannot be touching horizontally, vertically 
    or diagonally. There are two single tiles that need to be turned on in this 
    board. Use the fact that they cannot touch and the legend to turn on 
    the two correct tiles. Note: every game will tell you what to turn on at 
    the bottom of the screen and will follow this format. To continue, turn on 
    the correct tiles.
    \n\n
    Turn on:\n
    Two sets of one
    </string>
    
    <string name="tutorial_four">
    Sometimes tiles that need to be turned on come in sets. A set is made up of 
    two to four tiles placed together vertically or horizontally on the board. 
    The tiles that make up a set are allowed to touch the other tiles in the 
    set. However, sets cannot touch other tiles on the board that also need to 
    be turned on. Just like the no touching rule discussed previously. 
    To continue, turn on the correct tiles.

    <string name="tutorial_five">
    The different difficulty levels change the number of free empty and turned 
    on tiles given to you at the start of a game. Free empty tiles are black 
    with a T in them and do not change state. Use these to help you locate the 
    other tiles on the board that need to be turned on. To continue, turn on 
    the correct tiles.
